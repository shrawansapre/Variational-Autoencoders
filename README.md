# Variational Auto Encoder

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The data is stored in a very simple file format designed for storing vectors and multidimensional matrices.

There are 4 files:
train-images-idx3-ubyte: training set images 
train-labels-idx1-ubyte: training set labels 
t10k-images-idx3-ubyte:  test set images 
t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte:  test set labels

The training set contains 60,000 examples, and the test set 10,000 examples.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

1. Python [3.6.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/)
2. Python dependencies used:

   * Keras
   ```
    $ pip3 install keras # for python 3.x 
   ```
  * Numpy
  ```
    $ pip3 install numpy # for python 3.x 
  ```
  * Matplotlib
  ```
    $ pip3 install matplotlib # for python 3.x 
  ```

## Usage

1. Open variationalautoencoder.ipnyb in Jupyter
2. Run each cell to see the desired output.
