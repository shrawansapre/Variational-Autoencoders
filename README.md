# Variational Auto Encoder

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The data is stored in a very simple file format designed for storing vectors and multidimensional matrices.

There are 4 files:
train-images-idx3-ubyte: training set images 
train-labels-idx1-ubyte: training set labels 
t10k-images-idx3-ubyte:  test set images 
t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte:  test set labels

The training set contains 60,000 examples, and the test set 10,000 examples.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.
